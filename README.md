# Baccarat Game with Tkinter GUI

This is an educational project to learn Python and Tkinter.

## Motivation

I am teaching a colleague how to code in Python. He was
curious about how to make a GUI. I thought it would be fun to make a
a casino game. I chose Baccarat because it is simple to understand, but the
actual game has interesting rules and logic.

## Setup

Use python >= 3.11, and have Tkinter available.

## My implementation

I have implemented the game logic in the `baccarat` module.

You can play the game in the terminal by running `python play_cli.py`. Or you can
play the game with a GUI by running `python play_gui.py`.


## The assignment

I took my implementation and removed all the code. I left the docstrings and
the function signatures, see [stub.py](stub.py). I also left the tests (95% coverage). The assignment is to implement
the game logic and the GUI.
